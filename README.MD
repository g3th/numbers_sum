## Numbers Sum
## Add all numbers in a given number
### Uses two different methods of obtaining the result.

Enter a number (i.e. 123) and the sum of all numbers is returned (i.e. 6).

The first code snippet will return the result by obtaining the numbers as string indexes.

The second code will return the result by recursion, using division and mod.
